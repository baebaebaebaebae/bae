title: Share Links
description: Share tracks and albums with anyone via a URL
---

Share a track or album with anyone via a link. The recipient plays it in their browser -- no account, no app needed.

## How it works

1. Right-click a track or album in bae and choose **Share**
2. bae generates a URL like `https://your-server.com/share/{token}`
3. Send the link to anyone

The recipient opens the link and sees cover art, track info, and an audio player. They can listen and download.

## What recipients see

- Cover art and track metadata
- Audio player with playback controls
- Download button for each track
- For albums, the full track list with individual playback and download

## Server requirement

Share links require your server to be reachable from the internet:

- **bae-proxy** -- share links are served through bae-proxy. bae-web fetches encrypted share data via bae-proxy and decrypts it in the browser using the key from the URL fragment.
- **bae-desktop --headless** -- run on a home server or VPS and make it reachable via a reverse proxy, Tailscale Funnel, ngrok, or Cloudflare Tunnel.

Links can optionally expire. Expired links stop working.
