description: Share tracks and albums with anyone via a URL
---

Share a track or album with anyone via a link. Whoever has the link can play it in their browser — no account, no app needed.

## How it works

1. Right-click a track or album in bae and choose **Share**
2. bae generates a URL like `https://your-server.com/share/{token}`
3. Send the link to anyone

The recipient opens the link in their browser. They see cover art, track info, and an audio player. They can listen and download.

## The share token

The URL contains a signed token encoding:

- **What to play** — track ID or album ID
- **Expiry** — optional timestamp after which the link stops working
- **HMAC signature** — prevents forging or tampering

The token is the auth. Possession of the URL means permission to play. No credentials needed.

## Server requirement

Share links require your server to be reachable from the internet. Two options:

**bae-desktop**: Leave the app running and make port 4533 reachable. Options include a reverse proxy with a custom domain, Tailscale Funnel, ngrok, or Cloudflare Tunnel.

**bae-server**: Run `bae-server` in the cloud pointed at your cloud home. Same share link format, same token validation, no desktop app needed.

## What recipients see

- Cover art and track metadata
- Audio player with playback controls
- Download button for each track
- "Open in bae" button to save to their own library (requires bae installed)

For albums, the share page shows the full track list with individual playback and download.

## Security

- Links are scoped to a single track or album
- Expired links stop working
- Tokens can't be modified (HMAC-signed)
- Recipients can only access the specific resource in the link
