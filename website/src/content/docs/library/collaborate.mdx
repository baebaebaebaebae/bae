description: Collaborate on a shared library with full read and write access
---

Collaborate is for someone who wants full read and write access -- importing, editing metadata, curating together. Every change syncs to all members.

## How it works

1. The joiner shares their **public key** with the owner
2. The owner sends back an **invite code**
3. The joiner pastes the invite code and syncs

The invite code wraps the library's encryption key to the joiner's public key, grants storage access, and creates a membership entry.

## Roles

- **Owner** -- can invite and revoke members, and make all edits
- **Member** -- can make all edits, but cannot manage membership

## Revocation

An owner can revoke any member. When a member is revoked, a new encryption key is generated and re-wrapped to all remaining members. The revoked member can no longer decrypt new data.

The last owner of a library cannot be revoked.

## Attribution

Every change carries the author's public key. bae maps public keys to display names locally, so you can see who imported a release or edited metadata.

See [Sharing (Architecture)](/architecture/sharing) for technical details on the membership chain, signed changesets, and identity model.
