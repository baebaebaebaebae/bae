title: Sharing a Library
description: Follow, join, and collaborate on libraries
---

bae supports multiple levels of sharing — from read-only browsing to full collaborative editing.

## Identity

Each bae user has a global Ed25519 keypair — one identity across all libraries. The keypair is generated on first use and stored in your OS keyring. Your public key is how other members recognize you.

There is no global directory. You can't search for a user by name. All sharing happens via codes exchanged out-of-band (in person, over a chat app, etc.).

## Follow

Follow lets someone browse your full catalog as a read-only remote library. They stream through your server — they never touch your cloud home.

### How to set up follow

1. You generate a **follow code** in bae
2. Send it to the person you want to share with
3. They paste it into bae
4. Your library appears alongside theirs as a read-only remote library

Follow requires either bae-desktop running or bae-server reachable from the internet. The follower connects directly to your server for playback.

## Join

Join is for a collaborator who wants to contribute to the same library — importing music, editing metadata, and curating together. Both people get full read and write access, with every change synced to all members.

### How to join

1. The joiner shares their **public key** with the owner
2. The owner sends back an **invite code** — this wraps the library's encryption key to the joiner's public key, grants storage access, and creates a signed membership entry
3. The joiner pastes the invite code and syncs

Under the hood: bae shares the cloud home folder (on consumer clouds) or mints credentials (on S3), wraps the encryption key in a sealed box to the joiner's public key, and bundles everything into the code.

### Roles

- **Owner** — can invite and revoke members, and make all edits
- **Member** — can make all edits, but cannot manage membership

The first entry in the membership chain is always the library creator adding themselves as owner.

## Membership chain

A library's membership is tracked by an append-only chain of signed entries stored in the cloud home. Each entry records an Add or Remove action, signed by a current owner.

## Signed changesets

Every changeset pushed to the cloud home is signed by its author. On pull, bae verifies that the author was a valid member at the time the changeset was created. Changesets from non-members or with invalid signatures are discarded.

## Revocation

An owner can revoke any member:

1. A signed Remove entry is added to the membership chain
2. A new library encryption key is generated
3. The new key is re-wrapped to all remaining members
4. The revoked member's wrapped key is deleted

After revocation, the removed member can no longer decrypt new data. Old data (encrypted with the previous key) remains accessible to them.

The last owner of a library cannot be revoked. At least one owner must always remain.

## Attribution

Every changeset carries the author's public key. bae maps public keys to display names locally, so you can see who imported a release or edited metadata.
