title: Sharing a Library
description: Invite others to your library
---

bae lets you share your entire library with other people. Everyone gets full read and write access — importing, editing, and deleting — with every change synced to all members.

## Identity

Each bae user has a global Ed25519 keypair — one identity across all libraries. The keypair is generated on first use and stored in your OS keyring. Your public key is how other members recognize you.

## Membership

A library's membership is tracked by an append-only chain of signed entries stored in the sync bucket. Each entry records an Add or Remove action, signed by a current owner.

There are two roles:

- **Owner** — can invite and revoke members, and make all edits
- **Member** — can make all edits, but cannot manage membership

The first entry in the chain is always the library creator adding themselves as owner.

## Inviting someone

To invite a new member:

1. The invitee generates their keypair (happens automatically on first launch)
2. They share their public key with you (copy-paste, QR code, etc.)
3. You invite them from **Settings → Members** — this wraps your library's encryption key to their public key and creates a signed membership entry
4. You share the sync bucket coordinates with them
5. They connect, unwrap the key, download the library, and start syncing

The library key is encrypted specifically to the invitee's key using a sealed box. Only they can decrypt it.

## Signed changesets

Every changeset pushed to the sync bucket is signed by its author. On pull, bae verifies that the author was a valid member at the time the changeset was created. Changesets from non-members or with invalid signatures are discarded.

Unsigned changesets from before the membership chain was created are grandfathered — they predate the identity system and are trusted.

## Revocation

An owner can revoke any member:

1. A signed Remove entry is added to the membership chain
2. A new library encryption key is generated
3. The new key is re-wrapped to all remaining members
4. The revoked member's wrapped key is deleted

After revocation, the removed member can no longer decrypt new data. Old data (encrypted with the previous key) remains accessible to them — they had legitimate access and could have downloaded everything.

The last owner of a library cannot be revoked. At least one owner must always remain.

## Attribution

Every changeset carries the author's public key. bae maps public keys to display names locally, so you can see who imported a release or edited metadata. Display names are set during invitation and stored per-device.
