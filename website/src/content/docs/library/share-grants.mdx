description: Share individual releases across libraries
---

Share grants let you share a single release with someone without giving them access to your entire library.

## Creating a grant

1. Open the release and choose **Share**
2. Enter the recipient's public key
3. Optionally set an expiration
4. bae generates the grant token -- copy it or send it to the recipient

## Accepting a grant

1. Import the grant in bae (paste or open the file)
2. bae verifies the signature and checks the expiration
3. The release becomes available in your library

The shared release streams directly from the sharer's cloud home. You do not need to download or store the files yourself.

See [Sharing (Architecture)](/architecture/sharing) for how grant tokens are constructed and secured.
