title: Share Grants
description: Share individual releases across libraries

Share grants let you share a single release with someone without giving them access to your entire library.

## How it works

A share grant is a self-contained token that gives the recipient access to one release. It contains:

- The library encryption key (sealed-box encrypted to the recipient's public key)
- Your cloud home coordinates so they can fetch the files
- Optionally, S3 credentials for bucket access
- An expiration date (optional)
- Your signature, so the recipient can verify it came from you

The encryption key and any S3 credentials are sealed-box encrypted to the recipient's public key. Only they can open it.

## Creating a grant

To share a release:

1. Open the release and choose **Share**
2. Enter the recipient's public key
3. Optionally set an expiration
4. bae generates the grant token -- copy it or export as a file

## Accepting a grant

When you receive a share grant:

1. Import it in bae (paste or open the file)
2. bae verifies the signature and checks the expiration
3. The encrypted payload is unwrapped with your private key
4. The release becomes available in your library

The shared release plays back directly from the sharer's cloud home. You do not need to download or store the files yourself.

## Security properties

- The encryption key is sealed-box encrypted to the recipient's public key -- only they can decrypt it
- S3 credentials (if included) are encrypted end-to-end, never in the clear
- The grant is signed, so it cannot be tampered with or forged
- Expiration is checked on accept -- expired grants are rejected
