description: Browse someone's library as a read-only remote library
---

Follow lets someone browse your full catalog as a read-only remote library. They stream through your server -- they never touch your cloud home.

## How it works

1. Generate a **follow code** in bae
2. Send it to the person you want to share with
3. They paste it into bae
4. Your library appears alongside theirs as a read-only remote library

The follow code encodes your server URL, encryption key, and library name. The follower decrypts locally -- the server just proxies encrypted blobs.

## Server requirement

Follow requires either bae-desktop or a bae-proxy reachable from the internet. Set a public URL in Settings > Server.

See [Sharing (Architecture)](/architecture/sharing) for technical details on identity and the membership chain.
