title: Share Links
description: Share tracks and albums with anyone via a URL
---

Share a track or album with anyone via a link. The recipient plays it in their browser -- no account, no app needed.

## How it works

1. Right-click a track or album in bae and choose **Share**
2. bae generates a URL like `https://your-server.com/share/{token}`
3. Send the link to anyone

The recipient opens the link and sees cover art, track info, and an audio player. They can listen and download.

## What recipients see

- Cover art and track metadata
- Audio player with playback controls
- Download button for each track
- For albums, the full track list with individual playback and download

## Server requirement

Share links require a server reachable from the internet:

- **bae-desktop** (GUI or `--headless`) -- set a public URL in Settings > Server. bae-desktop serves share data directly from the cloud home.
- **bae-proxy** -- for zero-knowledge cloud hosting. bae-web fetches encrypted share data through bae-proxy and decrypts in the browser.

Links can optionally expire. Expired links stop working.
