description: How bae handles album and track metadata
---

bae enriches your library with detailed metadata from online databases.

## Sources

bae uses MusicBrainz and Discogs to populate metadata. See [Data Sources](/importing/data-sources) for details on what each service provides, authentication, and rate limits.

## What's stored

When you import an album, bae saves:

- **Album info**: Title, artist, year, genre
- **Track info**: Names, durations, track numbers
- **Artwork**: Cover images in multiple sizes
- **Credits**: Producers, engineers, musicians
- **Release info**: Label, catalog number, barcode, format
- **External IDs**: Discogs release ID, MusicBrainz IDs

## Editing metadata

You can manually edit metadata for any album:

1. Click an album to open it
2. Click the edit icon
3. Make your changes
4. Save

Changes are stored in bae's database. Your audio files are not modified.

## Re-matching

If you picked the wrong release during import, you can re-match:

1. Open the album
2. Click **Re-match**
3. Search for the correct release
4. Select it to update the metadata
