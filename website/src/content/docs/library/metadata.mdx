description: How bae handles album and track metadata
---

bae populates your library with metadata from online databases during import.

## Sources

bae uses MusicBrainz and Discogs to populate metadata. See [Data Sources](/importing/data-sources) for details on what each service provides, authentication, and rate limits.

## What's stored

When you import an album, bae saves:

- **Album info**: Title, artist, year
- **Track info**: Names, durations, disc and track numbers
- **Artwork**: Cover images from MusicBrainz Cover Art Archive and Discogs
- **Release info**: Label, catalog number, barcode, country, format
- **External IDs**: Discogs release ID, MusicBrainz release and artist IDs

All metadata comes from MusicBrainz and Discogs — bae does not read embedded tags from your audio files.
