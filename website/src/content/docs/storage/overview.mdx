bae gives you full control over where your music is stored. You can manage storage yourself, or let bae handle it for you.

## Self-managed Storage

Point bae at files you already have organized. bae indexes them but doesn't move, copy, or touch anything. If you already have terabytes of music arranged your way, this lets you catalog it without duplicating a single byte.

The tradeoff: bae can't encrypt, transfer, or sync self-managed files. If you move or rename them outside bae, it loses track.

## bae-managed Storage

Let bae organize and store your files. When you import music, bae copies it to your configured storage location. Your originals are untouched -- you can delete them after import if you want.

Managed storage supports:
- **Transfer** -- move releases between profiles (local to cloud, cloud to local, etc.)
- **Encryption** -- cloud files are always encrypted before leaving your machine
- **Sync** -- cloud-stored files can be accessed from other devices

### Local Profiles

A folder on your computer or external drive. bae copies files into a hash-based layout. Not encrypted.

### Cloud Profiles

S3-compatible cloud storage (AWS S3, MinIO, Backblaze B2, etc.). Files are encrypted with XChaCha20-Poly1305 before upload. See [Encryption](/storage/encryption) for details.

## How It Works

1. You create **storage profiles** in Settings
2. When importing a release, you pick which profile to use (or "None" for self-managed)
3. bae copies the files to that storage location
4. The release is linked to that profile

You can have different releases in different places -- some local, some in the cloud, some self-managed.
