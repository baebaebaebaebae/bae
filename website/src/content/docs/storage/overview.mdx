description: How bae stores your music files
---

bae gives you control over where your music is stored. Files can stay on your machine, or you can set up a cloud home for encrypted backup and multi-device sync.

## At a Glance

|                          | Self-managed     | Cloud home (managed) |
|--------------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Files live at            | Your location    | Cloud provider       |
| Copies files on import   | No               | Yes (upload)         |
| Encrypted at rest        | No               | Yes                  |
| Sync across devices      | No               | Yes                  |
| You manage the files     | Yes              | No                   |
| Delete release removes files | No           | Yes                  |

## Self-managed Storage

Point bae at files you already have organized. bae indexes them but doesn't move, copy, or touch anything. If you already have terabytes of music arranged your way, this lets you catalog it without duplicating a single byte.

The tradeoff: bae can't encrypt, sync, or back up self-managed files. If you move or rename them outside bae, it loses track.

## Cloud Home

A cloud home is a single storage location that holds your entire library — encrypted music files, metadata changesets, artwork, and snapshots. Setting one up enables multi-device sync and cloud backup.

Supported providers:

- **Google Drive** — sign in with OAuth, bae creates a folder in your Drive
- **Dropbox** — sign in with OAuth
- **OneDrive** — sign in with OAuth
- **pCloud** — sign in with OAuth
- **iCloud Drive** (macOS) — uses your iCloud container, no sign-in needed
- **S3-compatible** — any bucket (AWS S3, Backblaze B2, Cloudflare R2, Wasabi, MinIO, etc.)

Consumer cloud providers (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) use OAuth sign-in — no API keys or bucket configuration. iCloud Drive (macOS only) uses your existing iCloud container with no sign-in. S3-compatible providers require manual credential setup and are aimed at more technical users.

When you import a release as managed, bae encrypts the files and uploads them to your cloud home. Your originals stay untouched.

## How It Works

1. Set up a cloud home in **Settings → Sync** (OAuth sign-in or S3 credentials)
2. When importing a release, choose **bae-managed** or **Self-managed**
3. Managed imports are encrypted and uploaded to your cloud home
4. Other devices connected to the same cloud home sync automatically
