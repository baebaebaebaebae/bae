## Overview

bae helps you build and organize your music library. Here's what you can do:

1. **Import music** from local files (individual tracks or CUE/FLAC albums)
2. **Enrich metadata** automatically from MusicBrainz and Discogs
3. **Browse your library** by artist, album, genre, or year

## Your first import

### Import local files

The easiest way to start is importing music you already have:

1. Click the **Import** button in the sidebar
2. Select **Local Files**
3. Choose a folder containing your music
4. bae scans the folder and shows you what it found
5. Select a MusicBrainz or Discogs release to match
6. Click **Import**

bae pulls in metadata, downloads artwork, and stores the files according to your storage choice.

### Library location

By default, bae stores library metadata in:

- **macOS**: `~/.bae/libraries/<library-id>/`

Audio files are either encrypted and uploaded to your cloud home, or indexed in place (self-managed). See [Storage Overview](/storage/overview) for details.
