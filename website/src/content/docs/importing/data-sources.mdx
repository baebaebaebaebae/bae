description: External services bae uses for metadata and artwork
---

bae uses external services during import to fetch metadata and artwork. Here's what each service provides and how to set them up.

## MusicBrainz

<a href="https://musicbrainz.org" target="_blank">MusicBrainz</a> is an open music encyclopedia and bae's primary metadata source. It provides:

- Comprehensive track listings
- Release group information
- ISRC codes
- CD TOC matching for accurate CD identification
- Linked external URLs (including Discogs cross-references)

### Authentication

No API key needed. MusicBrainz is free and open.

### Rate limits

MusicBrainz enforces an average of 1 request per second per IP address. If you exceed this, MusicBrainz returns 503 errors and may temporarily block your IP. bae spaces requests automatically to stay within this limit.

### Learn more

See <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API" target="_blank">MusicBrainz API docs</a> and <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API/Rate_Limiting" target="_blank">rate limiting details</a>.

## Discogs

<a href="https://www.discogs.com" target="_blank">Discogs</a> is a music database and marketplace. It's especially strong for:

- Vinyl releases and pressings
- Detailed credits (producer, engineer, etc.)
- Catalog numbers and barcodes
- Label information

### Authentication

Discogs requires a personal API token. You'll set this up during bae's initial configuration, and each user needs their own token.

### Rate limits

Discogs allows 60 authenticated requests per minute. bae handles this automatically.

### Get started

Get your token from <a href="https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers" target="_blank">Discogs Developer Settings</a>. Paste it during setup and you're good to go.
