Import FLAC files you already have on your computer. Point bae at a folder, match it to a release, and it's in your library.

## Supported formats

bae currently supports **FLAC** -- both individual files and CUE+FLAC disc images.

| Layout | What it looks like |
|--------|-------------------|
| File per track | `01 - Song.flac`, `02 - Song.flac`, ... |
| CUE+FLAC | `album.cue` + `album.flac` (single file, split by cue sheet) |
| Multi-disc CUE+FLAC | `CD1/disc1.cue` + `CD1/disc1.flac`, `CD2/...` |

## How it works

1. Click **Import** in the sidebar and select **Local Files**
2. Pick a folder containing an album

bae scans the folder, detects audio files and artwork, and moves to the identify step.

### Identify

bae needs to match your files to a known release so it can pull in proper metadata. A few ways this happens:

- **Automatically** -- if your folder has a LOG file (from EAC, XLD, etc.), bae calculates a <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Disc_ID" target="_blank">MusicBrainz disc ID</a> from the track offsets and lead-out sector. If there's no LOG, it falls back to computing the disc ID from a CUE sheet + FLAC file. Either way, the disc ID is looked up on MusicBrainz automatically, and this often finds an exact match with no manual effort.
- **Manually** -- search by artist and album name, barcode, or catalog number across both MusicBrainz and Discogs.

When you select a result, bae checks that the release's track count matches your local files. If there's a mismatch, the result is flagged and you can't accidentally import the wrong release.

### Confirm

Once matched, you review the release details. This is where you:

- **Pick artwork** -- bae fetches cover art from MusicBrainz's Cover Art Archive and Discogs. If your folder has image files (cover.jpg, front.png, etc.), those show up too. Choose whichever looks best.
- **Choose storage** -- select a [storage profile](/storage/profiles) or leave as self-managed. This determines whether bae copies the files or just indexes them in place.

Hit **Import** and bae pulls in the metadata, stores the files according to your choice, and the release appears in your library.

## Metadata

Matching to a release gives bae everything it needs:

- Track names, disc numbers, durations
- Artist, album, year, genre
- Label, catalog number, barcode
- Cover artwork from multiple sources

All of this comes from MusicBrainz and Discogs -- bae doesn't read embedded tags from your files.

## Storage options

You pick how bae handles the files during the confirm step:

- **bae-managed** -- bae copies files to a local folder or uploads to cloud storage (encrypted). Your originals stay untouched.
- **Self-managed** -- bae records where the files are without copying anything. Zero duplication, but no encryption or sync.

See [Storage Overview](/storage/overview) for the full comparison.

## Bulk import

Select a parent folder and bae scans recursively. Each album-sized subfolder becomes a separate import candidate -- scan once, import them one by one.
