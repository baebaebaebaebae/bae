Do not use music note icons (e.g., Lucide's `music`, `music-2`, `music-3`, `music-4`) anywhere in this app.

Music notes are cliché and don't convey useful information. Use more specific icons instead:

- **Missing album art**: Use `ImageIcon` (picture placeholder)
- **Track list/multiple files**: Use `RowsIcon` (stacked rows - emphasizes separateness)
- **Single disc/CUE+FLAC**: Use `DiscIcon` (unified whole)

The contrast between RowsIcon (separate items) and DiscIcon (unified whole) communicates meaningful information about the file structure.
