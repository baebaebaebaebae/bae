description: Don't abandon approaches without asking

When working on a fix or approach, keep going until it's complete. Don't bail out or switch to a different approach (like "let's just leave the warning" or "this is good enough") without explicitly asking for permission first. If you hit obstacles, work through them rather than giving up.
