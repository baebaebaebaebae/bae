# Import Flow UX Goals

## The Transformation

Import transforms **folders** into **identified, curated releases**.

```
Folders on disk  →  Potential releases  →  Matched releases  →  Library entries
   (unknown)         (detected)             (identified)         (curated)
```

Users start with "I have a bunch of folders." They end with "These are now part of my music collection with accurate metadata and artwork."

## Journey Stages

### Stage 1: Detection

**User has**: Folders somewhere on disk
**User gets**: A list of potential releases

The sidebar populates with detected folders that look like music releases. Each folder becomes a candidate. The user now sees what they're working with.

### Stage 2: Identification

**User has**: A folder that might be a release
**User gets**: A confirmed match to a known release in MusicBrainz/Discogs

This is where folders become releases. Three paths:

1. **Disc ID lookup** - Automatic match via CUE file fingerprint
2. **Multiple matches** - Disc ID matched several editions; user picks the right one
3. **Manual search** - User searches by artist/album, catalog number, or barcode

The file display shows artwork and scans—these help users identify the release (catalog numbers on spines, label logos, disc art).

### Stage 3: Curation

**User has**: A matched release
**User gets**: A library entry with chosen artwork and storage location

Users review the metadata, select cover art (remote or from local scans), choose where to store it. This is the curation step—making the release *theirs*.

### Stage 4: Completion

**User has**: Configured import settings
**User gets**: Release in their library

The folder is now a proper library entry with accurate metadata, chosen artwork, and organized storage.

## UI Serves the Journey

### Layout

Two essential areas:

| Area | Question | Content |
|------|----------|---------|
| Sidebar | "What folders do I have?" | Detected candidates (folder icon + name) |
| Main pane | "What's in this one, and what do I do with it?" | File display + search + results |

bae-desktop uses a three-column variant where files get their own middle column. Other platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows) use two columns with files displayed inline in the main pane above the search form. Either layout works — the key is that the file display is visible alongside the search workflow.

### Candidate Sidebar

Shows detected folders as simple folder items. No track counts or format strings — just the folder name and a status icon (pending/importing/done/incomplete). Incomplete candidates are dimmed and not selectable.

### File Display

Not a file browser — it's identification context. Grouped by type:

- **Audio** — CUE+FLAC pairs or track files. Confirms track count and format.
- **Images** — Scans often show catalog numbers, barcodes, edition info on spines and disc art.
- **Documents** — Rip logs, NFO files with release info.

### Search Form

Three search modes (tabs):
- **General** — artist + album fields
- **Catalog Number** — single field (e.g., "WPCR-80001")
- **Barcode** — single field (e.g., "4943674251780")

Catalog number and barcode searches are how users identify Japanese pressings, limited editions, and other releases where artist/album text search returns too many or too few results.

### Visual Grouping

The main pane (header + files + search + results) shares a background because it's all "about the selected folder." The sidebar is navigation; the main pane is the workspace.

## Core Principle

**Informed, confident imports.** At each stage, users should feel certain about what's happening. They're not copying files—they're building a curated music collection.

The transformation from "folder" to "library entry" should feel deliberate and satisfying.
